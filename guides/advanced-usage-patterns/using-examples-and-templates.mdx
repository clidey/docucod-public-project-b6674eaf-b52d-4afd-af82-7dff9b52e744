## Accelerate Your Workflow with Examples and Templates

Starting with ready-made examples and templates is a powerful way to jumpstart your creative process on the JSON Canvas infinite canvas. By loading thoughtfully crafted sample canvases, you can quickly explore core features, visualize common use cases, and adapt these foundations to your unique needs. This approach saves time, reduces setup friction, and helps you understand how to structure your own canvases effectively. Whether you're new or experienced, leveraging these resources streamlines your journey toward building rich visual narratives and spatial designs.

## Preparing to Use Examples and Templates

Before working with examples and templates, ensure that your environment is properly set up with the JSON Canvas interface loaded in a modern, compatible browser. Familiarity with basic navigation—such as zooming, panning, and node interaction—will make adapting samples easier. If you’re just getting started, the [Creating Your First Canvas guide](/guides/core-workflows/creating-your-first-canvas) is a perfect primer. Ready-made example canvases typically have the `.canvas` extension and contain predefined nodes and edges arranged to demonstrate practical layouts or features.<Source url="https://github.com/obsidianmd/jsoncanvas" paths={[{"path": "assets/canvas.js", "range": "1-234"}]} />

## Loading and Adapting Sample Canvases

Opening a sample canvas begins with loading the corresponding `.canvas` file into the application. This loads an already structured arrangement of nodes, groups, and edges, giving you a visual starting point. Once loaded, use the pan and zoom controls to orient yourself within the canvas and explore how nodes are spatially organized.

To tailor an example to your goals, you can drag nodes to reposition them freely, edit text nodes by clicking within their content area, or replace file nodes by updating the linked files. This hands-on adaptation helps you internalize the canvas structure and understand edge relationships as you customize content to fit your context.

Saving your modified canvas preserves your progress to return to later or share with others. The interface supports exporting the current canvas state as JSON, capturing your adapted layout and node data precisely.

<Tip>
Experimenting with a sample canvas is a practical learning tool. Try modifying node positions or content to see how changes affect your visualization in real time, then export your work as a new template.

## Sharing Your Customized Canvases

Once you’ve adapted an example to your needs, sharing it with colleagues or collaborators is straightforward. Export your canvas JSON file using the provided download controls. Recipients can load this file to view exactly what you created, preserving node positions, types, and connections.

For collaborative workflows, consider maintaining a shared library of template canvases that your team can iterate on. This ensures consistency in style and structure while fostering creativity through shared starting points.

<Warning>
Always verify file compatibility with your target application before sharing. Some apps may have specific import/export constraints or require additional metadata.
</Warning>

## Practical Tips for Working with Templates

Engaging with examples and templates effectively hinges on some best practices:

- Begin by exploring the sample canvas in read-only mode to familiarize yourself with its layout without risk.
- Use the pan, zoom, and selection tools to investigate nodes and edges clearly.
- When modifying file nodes, ensure the linked files exist or update paths accordingly to avoid broken links.
- Regularly export your progress to preserve your customizations.

These approaches help prevent common pitfalls and support a smooth onboarding experience with JSON Canvas’s advanced usage patterns.

For deeper insights, consult the [Core Concepts and Terminology](/overview/concepts-and-workflows/core-concepts) page to understand the building blocks of canvases, and the [Integration and Sharing Your Canvases](/guides/advanced-usage-patterns/integration-and-sharing) guide to expand on collaborative workflows.

Explore the sample canvas file structure demonstrated in [sample.canvas](/sample.canvas) and see the live interplay of nodes and edges in the integrated view, giving concrete examples of how templates are organized visually and structurally.<Source url="https://github.com/obsidianmd/jsoncanvas" paths={[{"path": ".layouts/canvas.html", "range": "1-112"}]} />
