## Discover What JSON Canvas Enables

JSON Canvas brings infinite canvas data to life by combining a dynamic visual workspace with a powerful JSON-based format. This page offers a rapid introduction to JSON Canvas’s essential capabilities, demonstrating how the canvas UI, script integration, styling, and extensibility come together to empower you in navigating, organizing, and visualizing complex information spatially. Understanding these key features early unlocks the potential to craft interactive, richly formatted canvases that suit diverse workflows and applications.

## What You Can Achieve with JSON Canvas

At its core, JSON Canvas is designed to give you the freedom to interact with information across an expansive digital surface. Here, nodes representing files, text, links, or groups can be freely positioned, connected, and styled. The canvas UI makes manipulating this space intuitive and responsive, allowing smooth dragging, panning, and zooming that keep you focused on your content rather than the interface. Combined with script support, which lets you dynamically adjust, highlight, or serialize canvas elements, JSON Canvas ensures that your visual arrangements are more than static diagrams—they become interactive, data-driven environments.

Styling capabilities let you customize colors, sizes, and layouts to fit your visual language or branding needs, while extensibility through scripts and configuration opens pathways to tailor behavior precisely. Whether you need to visualize project dependencies, build knowledge maps, or integrate external files seamlessly, JSON Canvas’s features address these tasks with adaptable precision.

### An Example in Action
Imagine you have several files and notes scattered across the canvas, grouped visually to represent project phases. A script can highlight all related notes dynamically or export the current canvas state into a sharable `.canvas` file. The UI’s pan-and-zoom gestures allow you to effortlessly navigate between high-level overviews and detailed views without losing context.

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {"id": "node1", "type": "file", "file": "readme.md", "x": 100, "y": 200, "width": 480, "height": 320, "color": "6"},
    {"id": "node2", "type": "text", "text": "Project overview notes", "x": 650, "y": 180, "width": 300, "height": 150}
  ],
  "edges": [
    {"id": "edge1", "fromNode": "node1", "toNode": "node2", "fromSide": "right", "toSide": "left", "toEnd": "arrow"}
  ]
}
```

## Core Features at Your Fingertips

JSON Canvas’s primary strength lies in its combination of visual and programmatic controls. The canvas supports:

- **Infinite Spatial Freedom:** Position nodes anywhere, group them visually, and connect via edges that represent relationships.

- **Dynamic Interaction:** Intuitive drag-and-drop, smooth pan-and-zoom controls, and touch support ensure fluid navigation and immediate feedback while organizing nodes.

- **Rich Script Support:** Scripts enable dynamic manipulation of the canvas, such as highlighting specific node groups or serializing the canvas state to JSON for export.

- **Custom Styling:** Colors, sizes, and background styles can be adjusted per node or group, helping you maintain clarity or brand consistency.

Collectively, these features create a canvas environment that is both visually powerful and deeply programmable, supporting a broad spectrum of visual organization needs.

## See the Features in Practice

Visualizing the power of JSON Canvas becomes tangible when manipulating it directly. Suppose you want to organize a research project’s resources: PDFs, notes, diagrams, and links can be represented as nodes scattered across the canvas. Drag any node to reposition it, connect nodes with edges to show dependencies, or group related nodes with a labeled container.

You can toggle the output panel to view live JSON serialization of your canvas, enabling quick export or sharing. Scripts integrated into the canvas can respond to interactions, for instance by highlighting all nodes within a group when hovered, or by auto-adjusting the viewport to fit all visible content.

The canvas’s pan-and-zoom controls respond to mouse wheel with ctrl key, on-screen buttons, or multi-touch gestures, making it accessible on desktops and touch devices alike. This blend of interactive and data-driven controls means your canvas is not just a passive diagram but a working environment reflecting your unique context.
